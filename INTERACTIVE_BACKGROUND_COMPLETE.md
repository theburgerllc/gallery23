---

## üåü Features Implemented

### 1. Time-of-Day Gradient System
**Brand-aligned colors that change throughout the day:**

- **Morning (6AM - 12PM)**: Cyan ‚Üí Sage ‚Üí Tan
  *Warm, energizing palette to welcome visitors*

- **Afternoon (12PM - 6PM)**: Teal ‚Üí Cyan ‚Üí Sage
  *Fresh, vibrant colors for peak browsing hours*

- **Evening (6PM - 9PM)**: Sage ‚Üí Teal ‚Üí Dark
  *Calming transition into night*

- **Night (9PM - 6AM)**: Dark ‚Üí Teal ‚Üí Sage
  *Subtle, sophisticated atmosphere*

**All gradients use art23 brand colors:**
- Cyan: `#72BDC2`
- Teal: `#388B9E`
- Sage: `#5C7572`
- Tan: `#988C7F`
- Dark: `#21221F`

### 2. Interactive Parallax Effects

**Mouse Parallax:**
- Radial gradients follow cursor position at 50% intensity
- Creates subtle depth and immersion
- Responds in real-time with 16ms throttling (60fps)

**Scroll Parallax:**
- Gradients shift vertically as user scrolls
- Primary gradient: 10% scroll rate
- Secondary gradient: 5% scroll rate (opposite direction)
- Creates dynamic, living background

**Animated Rotation:**
- Linear gradient rotates continuously
- 30-degree rotation per time unit
- Smooth, hypnotic effect

### 3. Floating Particle System

**Particle Configuration:**
- 30-40 particles on Gallery/Shop/Checkout pages
- 20 particles on Home/About/Contact (optimized for Spline 3D scenes)
- Particle color matches time-of-day gradient
- Size range: 1.5px - 3.5px
- 40% opacity for subtlety

**Particle Behavior:**
- Gentle floating movement (0.5 speed)
- Connects with subtle lines (150px distance, 20% opacity)
- Bounce off edges (no particles lost)
- Shadow/glow effects using brand colors

**Interactive Effects:**
- **Hover Repulse**: Particles move away from cursor (120px distance)
- **60fps Cap**: Performance-optimized animation
- **Retina Support**: Sharp rendering on high-DPI displays

### 4. Mobile Optimization

**Automatic mobile detection:**
- Detects screen width < 768px
- **Particles disabled** on mobile (performance)
- **Gradient only** with reduced blur (25px vs 40px)
- Mouse tracking disabled (uses center position)
- Lightweight, fast experience on all devices

### 5. Visual Enhancements

**Blur + Glow Effect:**
- Desktop: 40px blur with 1.1 brightness
- Mobile: 25px blur with 1.05 brightness
- Creates soft, ethereal atmosphere

**Enhanced Neumorphic Shadows:**
- Increased shadow contrast for visibility on gradients
- Darker shadows: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4-0.5)`
- Subtle highlights: `rgba(114, 189, 194, 0.03)` (brand cyan)
- Maintains neumorphic aesthetic

## üéØ Technical Implementation Details

### Z-Index Layering System
```
Layer -3: Gradient background (fixed, full-screen)
Layer -2: Particles (fixed, full-screen, desktop only)
Layer -1: (reserved for page-specific backgrounds)
Layer 0+: Page content (navbar, main, footer, modals, cart)
```

**Why this works:**
- Gradients render behind everything
- Particles float above gradient but behind all content
- No conflicts with navbar (z-50), cart sidebar (z-50), or modals

### Performance Optimizations

**Event Throttling:**
- Mouse move: 16ms (60fps)
- Scroll: 16ms (60fps)
- Resize: 100ms (mobile detection debounce)

**Particle Limits:**
- Gallery/Shop/Checkout: 35 particles (full effect)
- Home/About/Contact: 20 particles (reduced for Spline 3D compatibility)
- Mobile: 0 particles (disabled entirely)

**GPU Acceleration:**
- Uses only `transform`, `opacity`, `filter` CSS properties
- Hardware-accelerated animations
- No layout thrashing or reflows

**Lazy Initialization:**
- Particle engine initializes asynchronously
- Doesn't block initial page render
- Particles fade in smoothly once loaded

### Responsive Breakpoints

**Desktop (‚â•768px):**
- Full gradient with mouse/scroll parallax
- 20-35 particles with hover interactivity
- 40px blur + 1.1 brightness

**Mobile (<768px):**
- Simple rotating gradient (no parallax)
- No particles (performance)
- 25px blur + 1.05 brightness
- Centered gradient origin (no mouse tracking)

### Color Transitions

**Gradient updates every hour:**
- 6AM: Morning colors activate
- 12PM: Afternoon colors activate
- 6PM: Evening colors activate
- 9PM: Night colors activate

**Smooth transitions:**
- Background changes smoothly via CSS `transition: background 0.3s ease`
- No jarring color jumps
- Particle colors update to match gradient

## üîß Customization Options

### Adjusting Particle Count:
```javascript
// In GlowParticleBackground.jsx, line 90
const particleCount = hasSpline ? 20 : 35;

// Increase for more particles:
const particleCount = hasSpline ? 30 : 50;

// Decrease for subtlety:
const particleCount = hasSpline ? 10 : 20;
```

### Adjusting Blur Intensity:
```javascript
// In GlowParticleBackground.jsx, line 103
filter: isMobile ? 'blur(25px) brightness(1.05)' : 'blur(40px) brightness(1.1)',

// Stronger blur:
filter: isMobile ? 'blur(35px) brightness(1.08)' : 'blur(60px) brightness(1.15)',

// Lighter blur:
filter: isMobile ? 'blur(15px) brightness(1.03)' : 'blur(25px) brightness(1.05)',
```

### Changing Time-of-Day Colors:
```javascript
// In GlowParticleBackground.jsx, lines 27-33
const getGradientColors = () => {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  if (hour >= 6 && hour < 12) return [artColors.cyan, artColors.sage, artColors.tan];
  // Modify these arrays to change color combinations
};
```

### Disabling Particles Entirely:
```javascript
// In GlowParticleBackground.jsx, line 225
{!isMobile && init && (
  // Change to: {false && init && (
  // This will disable particles on all devices
)}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Particles not appearing
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `@tsparticles/react` and `@tsparticles/slim` installed
- Verify particle engine initialized (`init` state should be `true`)
- Check if mobile device (particles disabled by design)

### Issue: Performance degradation
**Solution**:
- Reduce particle count (see customization)
- Disable particles on more pages (add routes to `hasSpline` check)
- Reduce blur intensity
- Check for other performance issues (unrelated to background)

### Issue: Gradients look different than expected
**Solution**:
- Check time of day (gradients change hourly)
- Verify brand colors in `artColors` object
- Check browser compatibility (some older browsers don't support complex gradients)
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**:
- Ensure all dependencies in package.json
- Vercel build environment handles WSL2 issues automatically
- Check Vercel logs for specific error messages
