## 🚀 Ready to Use!

### Your First Deployment

1. **Test the build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Create a preview:**
   ```
   /deploy-preview
   ```

3. **Test the preview thoroughly**

4. **Deploy to production:**
   ```
   /deploy-production
   ```

### Quick Agent Test

Try asking Claude:
```
Use the code validator agent to check code quality
```

This will validate your build, check dependencies, and ensure best practices!

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Your `.env` file is already configured with:
- ✅ `VERCEL_TOKEN` - For Vercel deployments
- ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN` - For GitHub operations
- ✅ `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` - For error monitoring
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - For future database

**Important:** These tokens are sensitive. Never commit `.env` to git!

## 📊 Project Configuration

### Tech Stack (Adapted for)
- **Framework:** React 18.3 + Vite 5.4 ✅
- **Hosting:** Vercel ✅
- **Build:** `npm run build` → `dist/` ✅
- **Routing:** React Router ✅
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ✅

### Key Differences from Template
The agents were **adapted from a Next.js template** to work with your **Vite + React** setup:
- Build commands updated for Vite
- Project structure adapted (no `app/` directory)
- Test runner acknowledges no tests exist yet
- Simplified for SPA architecture

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Automated Deployments
```
/deploy-preview     # Safe preview testing
/deploy-production  # Live deployment
/emergency-rollback # Instant recovery
```

### 2. Code Quality Checks
```
Use the code validator agent to check code quality
```

### 3. Preview Testing
```
Use the qa tester agent to test the preview deployment at [URL]
```

### 4. Production Monitoring
```
Use the monitoring agent to check production health
```

### 5. Test Setup (Future)
```
Use the test runner agent to set up Vitest
```

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

### Standard Development Flow
```
1. Make code changes locally
2. Test with `npm run dev`
3. Run `/deploy-preview`
4. Test preview thoroughly
5. Run `/deploy-production`
6. Monitor with monitoring agent
```

### Emergency Flow
```
1. Issue detected in production
2. Run `/emergency-rollback` immediately
3. Site restored in < 10 seconds
4. Fix issue in preview
5. Test thoroughly
6. Redeploy when ready
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Automated Hooks
- ✅ Pre-deployment validation (builds must pass)
- ✅ Auto-formatting on file edits
- ✅ Production deployment safeguards
- ✅ Post-deployment health checks
- ✅ Build failure handling
- ✅ Security vulnerability scanning

### Permissions
The setup includes security controls:
- ✅ Cannot modify `.env` files
- ✅ Cannot run destructive commands
- ✅ Build validation required
- ✅ Production confirmation prompts

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test a preview deployment:**
   ```
   /deploy-preview
   ```

2. **Verify Vercel integration:**
   ```bash
   vercel whoami
   ```

3. **Check current code:**
   ```
   Use the code validator agent to check code quality
   ```

### Short-term
1. **Link to Vercel project** (if not already):
   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

2. **Set up GitHub repository** (if needed)

3. **Configure Vercel environment variables** in dashboard

### Long-term
1. **Add automated tests:**
   ```
   Use the test runner agent to set up Vitest
   ```

2. **Set up Sentry** for error tracking

3. **Enable Vercel Analytics** in dashboard

4. **Add CI/CD** via GitHub Actions (optional)

   Use the code validator agent to check code quality
   ```

2. **Create preview:**
   ```
   /deploy-preview
   ```

3. **Monitor production:**
   ```
   Use the monitoring agent to check production health
   ```

### Read the Docs
- Start with `CLAUDE_CODE_QUICKSTART.md`
- Then explore `.claude/README.md`
- Deep dive into individual agent files

### Experiment Safely
- All preview deployments are safe
- Hooks prevent common mistakes
- Rollback is instant if needed

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Always Preview First
Never deploy directly to production. Always test in preview!

### 2. Trust the Automation
The agents perform comprehensive checks. Trust their recommendations.

### 3. Monitor After Deployment
Use the monitoring agent to watch for issues after deploying.

### 4. Keep Deployments Small
Deploy one feature at a time. Easier to debug and rollback.

### 5. Don't Fear Rollback
If something goes wrong, rollback immediately. Fix properly before redeploying.
